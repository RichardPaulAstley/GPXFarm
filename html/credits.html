		<h2>Credits</h2>
		<p>Something important for the site. Some credits for the sprites, some informations, you'll find everything
			right here.</p>

		<h3>Code</h3>
		<p>The site has been created and updated by Vladcik / RirchardPaulAstley (PokeIdle vibes)
			<br>Even with some bad coding skills, I wanted to improve my level and what i've done with PokeIdle. It was
			the opportunity to create a dream game based of my experience (either GPX+ or Pokemon Hatching Project).
			<br>I started the game in early 2023 alone. During that time, I'll have to thanks Zaksabeast who guided me
			when I had some dumb issues and doubts. He also helped me to make the hatching button to work well.
			<br>I'll thanks all the beta-testers, from IRL people I know from decades now to people that were just fan
			of PHP or PokeIdle. All helped me to improve the game and find new ideas for it.
			<br>For obvious reasons related to PokeIdle, the code is not meant to be shared. Thank you.
