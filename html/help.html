    <h2>Help / Guide Page</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the help page of Pokemon Hatching Center. Either if you're new to the game or looking for a specific answer, this page will try to give you all the answers in order to enjoy the game as much as possible. It'll cover the bases of each pages in order to play the game, some shortcuts and some specific questions. Enjoy !</p>
    <h3>The Shiny Rate in this game is : 1/256</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="help-p">
    <h3>Shelter</h3>
    <p>The Shelter is the first page you'll head to when starting the game. You'll be able to pick some eggs in order to hatch them. The eggs you can find are based on some rarity factor. Pretty much, you'll see kind of eggs more often than others, so be careful to not miss any rare egg! Moreover, a few eggs are only available in the Shelter: It means that you'll not be able to breed them or to claim them on the token page.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="help-p">
    <h3>Team</h3>
    <p>The main page for your gameplay. There you'll be able to see your team, how your eggs or your Pokémon are leveling up. You'll be able to evolve and hatch them on this page. On the top of that, you'll find some statistics about your progress in the game. A simple page, but somewhere you'll spend a lot of time!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="help-p">
    <h3>PC</h3>
    <p>The PC is an important part of your gameplay. You'll be able to store and release your Pokemon there. Here are some tips: 
    <br>- You can buy more PC Boxes in the PC Shop. The maximum amount is limited but will be able to change in the future (allowing for more boxes)
    <br>- You can store your eggs! No issue with that if you want to have a stock of a specific Pokémon. However, you still can't release them
    <br>- You can release the Pokémon in your team only. For that, you must press Shift (or hold on mobile) and then click on the Pokemon of your choice. If you want to release the whole team, hold Ctrl + Shift and then clean of the Pokémon of your choice. You can't release Shiny with the team release feature.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="help-p">
    <h3>Daycare</h3>
    <p>The Daycare is the place if you want to Shiny Hunt some specific Pokémon. Here's a little summary of how it works:
    <br>- You can deposit two Pokemon of your team. Unbreedable Pokemon and eggs can't be put in the daycare. They'll not earn any experience by being in the daycare.
    <br>- If they are compatible, they'll be able to start breeding. It follows the core game's mechanics where the mother will pass the species.
    <br>- To have some eggs available, you must click some Pokemon. Based on the rarity of the Pokémon, the eggs will spawn more often.
    <br>- You can Ctrl + Click on the egg in the daycare to fill your team!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="help-p">
    <h3>Shop</h3>
    <p>The Shop is the place where you'll be able to buy items in order to update your gameplay or to evolve your Pokémon. You'll also be able to check your inventory and see if what items you already own.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="help-p">
    <h3>Tokens</h3>
    <p>This page is where you can get some specific eggs : From exclusive Pokémon to novelty, you'll be able to exchange Tokens (obtained by clicking Pokémon / Eggs) for these eggs. Arceus is not available at the moment,. Also novelties will be available in rotation once implemented in the game. Here're the rates :
      <br>Special: 1/1500, Event: 1/2500, Legendary: 1/5000, MissingNo. : 1/44404
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="help-p">
    <h3>Interactions</h3>
    <p>The last page and maybe the most important one. With the interaction page, you'll be able to help your Pokémon to hatch or to level up! You can do that either:
      <br>- By clicking on them. The active mode will give you slightly more experience and more money.
      <br>- By activating the PokeIdle mode. The game will click Pokemon and egg themself for free, but you'll not earn as much by clicking. Really cool when you want to focus on something else.
    <br>You can also check the current bonus (if there's one) and earn tokens randomly.
